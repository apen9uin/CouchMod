CouchMod
========
This is BeastlyPen9uin's couch mod

Created by TheBeast5282 and a_pen9uin

Basic Idea:
- This is just going to be a quick, clever mmod written by two early java students
- Basically, this will add (hopefully 2) structures: a bed, and a recliner(eventually)
- You can sleep in these just like a regular minecraft bed. However, instead of sleeping through the night,. . .
    you can sleep through the day to get to the night.
- Its an easy idea that some people might call on, when they need it
-   Plus: its kinda funny and clever to lay back in a recliner while your friends go mining
- Wish us luck! -Beast & Penguin
